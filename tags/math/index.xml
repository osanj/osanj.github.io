      <title>Using Spring Dynamics ODE for Animation Interpolation (Rebuilding Facebook Rebound)</title>

      <description>Rebound is an open-source project by Facebook. It is used to control the course of animations. In case you are familiar with Android, you might know that Android provides several Interpolator classes (AccelerateInterpolator, DecelerateInterpolator, ...) to handle that task. While most of these provide a rather simple course of animation, Facebook&#39;s Rebound is based on spring dynamics which is not trivial to implement. This article describes my attempt to reverse engineer the Rebound library.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You know that feeling when you have been using some rule blindly forever and one day you finally spend the time to figure out where this rule comes from? Below is my effort to visualize the integrals which lead to the formulas for surface area and volume of spheres.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
